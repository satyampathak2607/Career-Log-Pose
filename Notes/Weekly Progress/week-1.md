## Week-1 (24/06/2025):

### Day-1 - 24-06-2025
-> I set up the project skeleton on VS code , started documented my journey  and started learning essentials like pydantic and Fastapi basically the tech stack which i would be implementing in my project ..

### Day-2+3 - 25-06-2025 - 26-06-2025
-> I set up the backend and debugged the entire stuff including errors popping up while setting up the postgresql db on local , then i decided deploy the backend on render to get exposure but i had to debug over there too..there was some error in the root of the directory , had to brainstorm the entire night with my mentor (chatgpt lol) to fix it , in the end we did it, then we started with the front end work, i am learning react in parallel by building the project, at first i wanted to just use streamlit for the project but since this project is really special for me, i wanna give it my all and push through my comfort zone,
and well.. i faced a lot of issues in understanding the new syntax and yeah a lot of issues in making a simple registration frontend (yeah i took the help of gpt in it.. hope i will get familiar with the syntax and other core features of react soon ).. so yeah thats it for now.
